## What is FDS? ##

The NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) is a computational fluid dynamics model of fire-driven fluid flow. The software solves numerically a form of the Navier-Stokes equations appropriate for low-speed, thermally-driven flow, with an emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires.

## Who uses FDS? ##

Users are warned that FDS is intended for use only by those competent in the fields of fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, heat transfer, combustion, and fire science, and is intended only to supplement the informed judgment of the qualified user. FDS is a computer model that may or may not have predictive capability when applied to a specific set of factual circumstances. Lack of accurate predictions by the model could lead to erroneous conclusions with regard to fire safety. All results should be evaluated by an informed user.

## Who develops FDS? ##

| To those that develop and release FDS in the public domain a sincere _thank you_ |

The Fire Dynamics Simulator and Smokeview are the products of an international collaborative effort led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland.

## FDS support ##

The main source for FDS support is [its main website](http://firemodels.github.io/fds-smv/).
There you can find tutorials, manuals, videos, and help from the Community.

## Free coursebook, Fire Simulation for Engineers ##

At start, FDS official documentation can appear a little overwhelming. This is why a simpler wikibook is currently being worked on: [Fire Simulation for Engineers](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Fire_Simulation_for_Engineers), that complements [FDS official documentation](http://firemodels.github.io/fds-smv/manuals.html).
